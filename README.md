# Creditcard_fraudcheck_ML
1. First ML Project to check Credit card frauds

This is my first ML project to check wheather a transaction is fraud or ligit 


Model that predicts if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
You can model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud,
otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).

The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced.
This is also the case of the current dataset: only 492 transactions out of 284,807 are fraudulent (the positive class - the frauds - accounts for 0.172% of all transactions).

This is a Kaggle dataset. You can find this "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from the following link: Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Project successful score - 6/10.

Project successful score is the personel score i give myself how satisfied i am with this project .
